    <p>
      4+ years of industry experience at companies with 10s to 1,000s of employees, combined with deep-rooted care for my work and colleagues makes me an engaged and productive member of any team.
      I love using technical knowledge to solve problems and want this to be the driving force behind my professional progression.
      My ideal working culture nurtures continuous personal development, technical exploration and cross-team collaboration.
      I take a moderate stance on “technical debt”, striving to find the balance between upfront design/failing fast and iteration/waste.

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Implemented a sensing platform compatible with existing hardware.
        </li>
        <li>
          Extracted electronic and electrical requirements from IEC standards.

      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Onboarding quickly was important in the rapidly evolving environment at Mytos, whether learning how to use new software or understanding the user stories and international standards that were driving requirements.
      Being the only electronic engineer at my level meant a wide variety of technical and organisational work with new challenges daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Multi-threading was imperative, dynamically managing time across projects I had ownership of and supporting asynchronously on new failure modes.
      Pushed hard by the constraints of ambitious company-wide deadlines, I strengthened my context-switching skills; regularly designing or reviewing PCBs in the morning and writing firmware in C++ after lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company had an excellent culture of feedback, so I was able to address issues quickly and gain confidence in the areas I was excelling in.
      Shining a light on areas of personal and professional improvement with a regular cadence allowed me to consciously improve my cross-team communication and leadership skills.
      I was consistently praised by colleagues for my attention to detail, knowledge of EE principles, and enthusiasm towards my work.

      <b>Embedded Engineer</b>: <i>2021-2023</i>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Designed, built, and tested a real-time remote monitoring system.
        </li>
        <li>
          Helped deploy and commission a first generation product abroad.
        </li>
        <li>
          Strengthened skills across hardware, PCBs, firmware, and Linux.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Having joined AFC Energy during a period of rapid growth, there were ample opportunities to develop my skills.
      I worked on the requirements capture, schematic, and PCB design of the company's first prototype of a fully embedded controller, complete with high-speed USB, Ethernet, and multiple communications buses, which provided the foundations for the future versions used in deployments.
      This also involved owning the PCB component migration process from local disparate libraries to Altium 365.
    </p>
    <p>
      An important contribution I made was a Linux-based remote monitoring system.
      Initially an offline database of sensor data used to glean insights into failures after product deployments, it evolved into a real-time 4G connected implementation with a Grafana dashboard.
      I was responsible for gathering requirements, the hardware and software architecture, and taking the design from prototype to custom PCB.
      This built out my understanding of Linux command line tools and systemd, CAN bus, PostgreSQL databases, multi-threaded applications in Python, and networking fundamentals.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was also part of the team that deployed AFC Energy's first Power Tower generator on a construction site in Spain.
      As the only representative from the electronics team present, I was responsible for data monitoring, problem solving of all electrical issues, including diagnosing an earthing issue with the site's own mains power distribution, and being the main knowledge holder for generator operation.
      This experience reinforced my passion for hands-on and tangibly beneficial work for the customer.

      <b>Sensors Engineer</b>: <i>2019-2021</i> ⋯ <b>Graduate Engineer</b>: <i>2018-2019</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Built prototypes and ran user trials to test new sensor technologies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Represented team abroad at a supplier and international conference.
        </li>
        <li>
          Proposed, designed, and delivered a custom data visualiser in Python.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      At Dyson, I worked on technical design tasks across the full lifecycle of products, which gave me an appreciation of the value of investing time upfront and catching issues early.
      I travelled abroad on multiple occasions, including an international sensor conference and a key supplier at their headquarters to collaborate with their engineers.
      In parallel, I mentored several undergraduates who interned in my team by writing their project plans, managing their day-to-day needs, and providing feedback to their academic supervisors.
    </p>
    <p>
      A key piece of work I suggested and delivered was a custom visualisation tool written in Python, replacing an outdated Excel-based system for analysing gigabytes of test data.
      The vastly improved efficiency led to an increase in both the quantity of tests and quality of insight that was possible.
      Detailed documentation allowed its use to continue by the test engineers themselves after I left the company.
